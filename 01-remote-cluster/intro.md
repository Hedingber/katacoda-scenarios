[MLRun](https://www.iguazio.com/open-source/mlrun/) is an end-to-end [open-source](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun)
MLOps solution to manage and automate your entire analytics and machine learning lifecycle, from data ingestion, through
model development, to full pipeline deployment in production.

MLRun offers a convenient abstraction layer to a wide variety of technology stacks while empowering data engineers
and data scientists to define the features and models with ease and flexibility.

MLRun is running as a built-in service in the [Iguazio Data Science Platform](https://www.iguazio.com/) and is
deeply integrated with other services in the platform. Its primary goal is to ease the development of machine
learning pipeline at scale and help organizations build a robust process for moving ML projects from the research
phase to fully operational production deployments.

In the following course you will learn how to:

- Set up a local Jupyter environment which connects to a remote MLRun/Iguazio service
- Train, test, and deploy a Model using MLRun
- Build an automated ML pipeline

More information about MLRun and its architecture can be found [here](https://docs.mlrun.org/en/latest).
