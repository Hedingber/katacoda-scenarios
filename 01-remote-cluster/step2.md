For a quick start demo of MLRun and how we use marketplace functions to train
, evaluate, and deploy models.
 
You can skip to the next step for a more complete demo

open the [quick-start.ipynb](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8888-[[KATACODA_HOST]].[[KATACODA_DOMAIN]]/doc/tree/quick-start.ipynb)
Notebook, and follow the different steps.

The demo steps include:
- Setting a project environment
- Train a model and generate various artifact (using MLRun marketplace function)
- Evaluate the model using a test set 
- Deploy the model as a real-time serving end-point (over Nuclio serverless functions)
