MLRun allow you to easily build serverless ML functions and compose batch and real-time pipelines using those functions.

In the following tutorial we have 4 Notebooks:
1. Understand the basics of MLRun functions and jobs (deploy a data prep function)
2. Train a model using custom training function and MLRun `auto-logging` 
3. Build and deploy serving pipelines with our model
4. Build Automated workflow to train, test, and deploy 
 

open the `tutorial` directory in Jupyter and run through the 4 notebooks, starting with
