[MLRun](https://www.mlrun.org) is an end-to-end [open-source](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun)
MLOps orchestration framework to manage and automate your entire analytics and machine learning lifecycle, from data ingestion, through
model development, to full pipeline deployment in production and model monitoring.

MLRun offers an integrative approach to manage your ML pipelines from early development through management in your production environment. MLRun offers  a convenient abstraction layer to a wide variety of technology stacks while empowering data engineers
and data scientists to define the features and models with ease and flexibility. MLRun includes an online and offline feature store that handles the ingestion, processing, transformation, metadata, and storage of data and features across multiple repositories and technologies.

MLRun runs as a built-in service in the [Iguazio MLOps Platform](https://www.iguazio.com/) and is
deeply integrated with other services in the Platform. Its primary goal is to ease the development of machine
learning pipeline at scale and help organizations build a robust process for moving ML projects from the research
phase to fully operational production deployments.

In the following course you will learn how to:
- Setup a local developer environment with MLRun
- Create and run various ML functions using an IDE
- Build workflows, Track artifacts and results
- Connect to remote clusters and rapidly deploy code and pipelines to production at scale

More information about MLRun and its architecture can be found [here](https://docs.mlrun.org/en/latest).
